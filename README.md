# Papers per Week

> Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought. -Albert Szent-Gyorgyi

A repository containing all of the papers that I'd be reading under my initiative of 2 papers per week.

However, this is an optimistic estimate, and actual numbers may be high or low depending on the depth of the paper and other academic engagements.
